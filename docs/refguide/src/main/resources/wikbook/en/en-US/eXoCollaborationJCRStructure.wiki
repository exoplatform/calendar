eXo Collaboration is a JCR-based product, so data of eXo Collaboration are managed by the eXo-JCR service with each specific structure. The chapter aims at outlining the JCR structure of each application in eXo Collaboration through diagrams and then describing properties of main node types.

Each diagram shows nodes and their primary node types. Every node/child node must have only one primary node type represented in the round bracket () under the node/childnode, but may also have many mixin node types. Because mixin nodes cannot define the node structure like the primary nodes, they are not shown in the diagrams and their properties hereafter are not described.

{note}
To learn more about the eXo Collaboration JCR Structure, you should have the certain knowledge of [JCR|http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=170].

h1. Calendar JCR Structure {anchor:id=CSref.JCRStructure.Calendar.JCR}

The Calendar data are saved in eXo-JCR under the CalendarApplication data directory. The Calendar JCR Structure is divided into two main branches: one for public (exo:application) and the other for users (Users).

The whole JCR structure of Calendar can be visualized in the diagram below:
