h1. eXo Chatserver Configuration {anchor:id=CSref.Configuration.eXoChatserverConfiguration}

h2.  Openfire Configuration {anchor:id=CSref.Configuration.OpenfireConfiguration}

The Chat service of eXo Collaboration is a Jabber engine powered by Openfire. eXo Platform will delegate the actual Jabber protocol communication to Openfire.

You have the full latitude to configure Openfire. There are two possible ways to do it:

* The admin console: http://localhost:9090/.

* The openfire.xml file in _$openfire\_home/conf/_.


h3. Configuration in Openfire.xml {anchor:id=CSref.Configuration.ConfigurationinOpenfirexml}

The Openfire server has a single configuration file called _openfire.xml_ and located under the _exo\-openfire/conf_ directory. Configuration is based on properties expressed in an XML syntax. For example, to set the property prop.name.is.blah=value, you would write this xml snippet:

{code:xml}
<prop>
  <name>
    <is>
      <blah>value</blah>
    </is>
  </name>
</prop>
{code}

Openfire has an extensive list of configuration properties. You can read a list of all properties on this page: http://www.igniterealtime.org/community/docs/DOC-1061.

h3. eXo specific configuration {anchor:id=CSref.Configuration.eXospecificConfiguration}

The eXo Collaboration bundle comes with a pre-configured Openfire server. It is bundled with some eXo plugins and configurations that allow connectivity with eXo Platform. The key properties for integration are:

* _provider.auth.className_: An implementation of the AuthProvider interface for authentication of users on the Chat server.

* _provider.users.className_: An implementation of the UserProvider interface to which Openfire will delegate users management.

* _provider.groups.className_: An implementation of the GroupProvider interface to which Openfire will delegate groups management.

eXo Platform provides implementations for these 3 interfaces with ExoAuthProvider, ExoUserProvider, ExoGroupProvider. These implementations are based on the eXo REST framework and let you configure the endpoints within the _openfire.xml_ file with additional properties:

|| Property || Default value || Description ||
|*eXo.env.serverBaseURL*| {{http://localhost:8080/}} | The base URL of the server. |
|*eXo.env.restContextName*| {{rest}} | The context name of REST Web application. |
| *provider.authorizedUser.name*| {{root}}| The username to authenticate to access the HTTP REST service. |
| *provider.authorizedUser.password* | {{gtn}} | The password matching with provider.authorizeduser.name. |
| *exoAuthProvider.authenticationURL* |{{/organization/authenticate/}} | The URL to authenticate users. |
| *exoAuthProvider.authenticationMethod* | {{POST}} | The HTTP method used for the authentication method. |
| *exoUserProvider.findUsersURL* | {{/organization/xml/user/find-all/}} |The URL to find all users. |
| *exoUserProvider.findUsersMethod* | {{GET}} | The HTTP method used to find all users in the system. |
| *exoUserProvider.getUsersURL* | {{/organization/xml/user/view-range/}} | The URL to retrieve a range of users.|
| *exoUserProvider.getUsersMethod* |  {{GET}} | The HTTP method used for user/view-range. |
| *exoUserProvider.usersCountURL* |  {{/organization/xml/user/count}} |The URL to count the number of users. |
| *exoUserProvider.usersCountMethod* | {{GET}} | The HTTP method used to count the number of users. |
| *exoUserProvider.userInfoURL* | {{/organization/xml/user/info/}} | The URL to get the information of users. |
| *exoUserProvider.userInfoMethod* | {{GET}} |The HTTP method used to get the information of users. |
| *exoGroupProvider.groupInfoURL* | {{/organization/xml/group/info/}} | The URL to get the information of a group of users. |
| *exoGroupProvider.groupInfoMethod*|  {{GET}} |The HTTP method used to get the information of a group of users. |
| *exoGroupProvider.getGroupsAllURL* |  {{/organization/xml/group/view-all/}} |The URL to view a list of all user groups. |
| *exoGroupProvider.getGroupsAllMethod* |  {{GET}} |The HTTP method used to view a list of all user groups. |
| *exoGroupProvider.getGroupsRangeURL* | {{/organization/xml/group/view-from-to/}} | The URL to list groups in a specific range. |
| *exoGroupProvider.getGroupsRangeMethod* |  {{GET}} |The HTTP method used to list groups in a specific range. |
| *exoGroupProvider.getGroupsForUserURL* | {{/organization/xml/group/groups-for-user/}} |The URL to list groups to which a user belongs. |
| *exoGroupProvider.getGroupsForUserMethod* | {{GET}} |The HTTP method used to list groups to which a user belongs. |
| *exoGroupProvider.groupsCountURL* |  {{/organization/xml/group/count}} |The URL to count the number of groups. |
| *exoGroupProvider.groupsCountMethod* |  {{GET}} |The HTTP method used to count the number of groups. |


As you can see, the default settings will only work if eXo Platform is deployed on the same host as Openfire, on the port 8080.

{note}
_restContextName_ is used to specify the Openfire server that is dedicated for the portal. If the _eXo.env.restContextName_ system property exists, it will override this value.

The _eXo.env.restContextName_ system property can be set by specifying the {{{ -D }}} option to the Java command when running Openfire.

For example:

* If the Openfire server is dedicated for the portal named "portal", the command will have the following format: _{{{ java -DeXo.env.restContextName=rest -jar ../lib/startup.jar}}}_.

* If the Openfire server is dedicated for the portal named "csdemo", the command will have following format: _{{{ java -DeXo.env.restContextName=rest-csdemo -jar ../lib/startup.jar}}}_.

By default, the Openfire server is dedicated to the portal named "portal".

h2. System Configuration {anchor:id=CSref.Configuration.SystemConfiguration}
Openfire makes use of several ports for communication.
|| Interface || Port || Type || Description ||
| *All addresses* | {{5222}} | {{Client to Server}} | The standard port for clients is to connect to the server. Connection may or may not be encrypted. You can update the security settings for this port. |
| *All addresses* | {{9090 & 9091}} | {{Admin Console}} | The ports used for the unsecured and secured Openfire Admin Console accesses respectively. |
| *All addresses* | {{7777}} | {{File Transfer Proxy}} | The port used for the proxy service that allows files to be transferred between two entities on the XMPP network.|
| *All addresses* | {{3478 & 3479}} | {{STUN Service}} | The port used for the service that ensures connectivity between entities behind a NAT.|

You can view the table above in _http\://hostname\:9090/index.jsp_ after you have logged into the Openfire's web console and also customize those ports by yourself.

h2. AS configuration {anchor:id=CSref.Configuration.ASConfiguration}
To enable the propagation of identity across the Chat webapp, you are required to enable the SSO valve on the Tomcat-based Application server.

* For the Jboss server, edit _jboss/server/default/deploy/jboss-web.deployer/server.xml_.

* For the Tomcat server, edit _tomcat/conf/server.xml_.
The valve should already be there, you just need to uncomment it if it is not already done.

{code:xml}
<Valve className="org.apache.catalina.authenticator.SingleSignOn" />
{code}

In case of the cluster deployment, you may want to use {{ClusteredSingleSignOn}} instead.

{code:xml}
<Valve className="org.jboss.web.tomcat.service.sso.ClusteredSingleSignOn" />
{code}
